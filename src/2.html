<h2>NANOTECHNOLOGY</h2>

<h5>[BY CAMERON., N., & MITCHELL, E. (EDS.).]</h5>

<article>
  <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
  <p>The miniaturization of science and engineering is just one aspect of the many ways 
    that the rapidly expanding ﬁeld of nanotechnology promises to revolutionize the 
    landscape of science, technology, and society. With potential applications stretching 
    across the wide spectrum of research and development in consumer electronics and 
    cosmetics, drug development and delivery in the pharmaceutical industry, medical 
    technologies and therapeutics, energy production and storage, environmental 
    engineering and remediation, industrial manufacturing, and textile production, 
    nanoscience and nanotechnologies have demonstrated breathtaking potential. 
    Some of its most ardent supporters project the future of this technology even more 
    optimistically. Others disagree, suggesting that hype surrounding speculative 
    nanotechnology is well beyond the plausible potential of the technology and seems more
    at home in science ﬁction novels and ﬁlms. This research paper explores the developing
    ﬁeld of nanotechnology and given its vast potential considers whether there are 
    inherent concerns or dangers in the utilization of these technologies. Additional 
    attention is given to ethical considerations and implications of these technologies, 
    as well as to policy questions that are raised with respect to regulating nanotechnology 
    for the public good.</p>

  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p>Few areas of research and development have captured the imagination with the potential 
    for such broad impact and implications as has nanoscience and nanotechnology. Applications 
    for nanotechnology cross such disparate ﬁelds of research, development, and production as 
    materials science (with agricultural, industrial/manufacturing, and textile applications), 
    energy production, environmental sciences, information and communication technologies, 
    cosmetics, healthcare (with diagnostics, drug delivery, gene therapy, and potential 
    contributions to regenerative medicine), and the possibility of futuristic applications with
    nanobots and nanotechnology assemblers. As of late 2014, an inventory by the Woodrow Wilson 
    Center identiﬁed over 1,800 consumer products containing nanoscale materials (Project on 
    Emerging Nanotechnologies 2014).</p>

  <p>“Nanoscale technology” or “nanotechnology” generally refers to the products of science 
    and engineering that seek to understand and control matter at the nanoscale level. While
    deﬁnitions of the terminology are not universally agreed upon, the U.S. National Nanotechnology 
    Initiative (NNI n.d.) deﬁnes the “nanoscale” as the “dimensional range of approximately 
    1–100 nm” (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). Comparatively, a sheet of paper is roughly 
    100,000 nm thick. The ability to manipulate and control materials at the nanoscale level offers 
    a variety of promising and wide-ranging applications. From enhancements to already existent 
    consumer products to advances in industrial manufacturing to regenerative medicine and the 
    possibility of futuristic applications, nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize 
    far-reaching aspects of human life. Strong proponents of the future of these technologies offer 
    visions that seem to stretch the limits of credulity and posit applications that may seem more 
    at home in science ﬁction novels and ﬁlms. Such proposals have led others to charge that this 
    very promise has led to unreasonable research hype and speculations, and thus critics within 
    the research and ethics communities increasingly are calling for more chastened projections of 
    potential research deliverables, as well as what they claim are more “realistic” potential beneﬁts.</p>

  <p>As an area of emerging technology, nanotechnology (at least in its formal use of nanoscience) 
    and the corresponding ﬁeld of nanotechnology ethics (or nanoethics) are relatively recent 
    developments of the 1990s with much of their growth occurring within the early years of the 
    twenty-ﬁrst century. The purpose of this research paper is to explore the historical background 
    leading to contemporary research, development, and product release of nanotechnologies; clarify key 
    terminology; examine recent, near future, and speculative applications of these technologies; and 
    conclude with a discussion of various ethical considerations raised by nanotechnologies.</p>

  <h3>DEFINING TERMS</h3>
  <p>IoT has a multidisciplinary vision to provide its beneft to several domains such as 
     environmental, industrial, public/private, medical, transportation etc. Diferent 
     researchers have explained the IoT diferently with respect to specifc interests and 
     aspects. Te potential and power of IoT can be seen in several application domains. 
     Figure 2 illustrates few of the application domains of IoTs potentials.
     Various important IoT projects have taken charge over the market in last few years. 
     Some of the important IoT projects that have captured most of the market are shown 
     in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, a global distribution of these IoT projects is shown among American, 
     European and Asia/Pacifc region. It can be seen that American continent are 
     contributing more in the health care and smart supply chain projects whereas contribution of 
     European continent is more in the smart city projects .t is evident 
     that industry, smart city, smart energy and smart vehicle based IoT projects have a big 
     market share in comparison to others.</p>
  <p>Smart city is one of the trendy application areas of IoT that incorporates smart homes 
     as well. Smart home consists of IoT enabled home appliances, air-conditioning/heating system, 
     television, audio/video streaming devices, and security systems which are 
     communicating with each other in order to provide best comfort, security and reduced 
     energy consumption. All this communication takes place through IoT based central 
     control unit using Internet. Te concept of smart city gained popularity in the last decade and 
     attracted a lot of research activities [9]. Te smart home business economy is 
     about to cross the 100 billion dollars by 2022 [10]. Smart home does not only provide 
     the in-house comfort but also benefts the house owner in cost cutting in several aspects 
     i.e. low energy consumption will results in comparatively lower electricity bill. Besides 
     smart homes, another category that comes within smart city is smart vehicles. Modern 
     cars are equipped with intelligent devices and sensors that control most of the components from 
     the headlights of the car to the engine [11].[8]..</p>

  <h3>CURRENT AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</h3>
  <p>Given that nanotechnologies are so wide ranging in their impact and applications, 
    what follows is merely a sampling of the various developments in recent years with 
    relevant comments to areas of active inquiry.

  <h5>1. INSTRUMENTATION</h5>
    A number of the early advances due to nanoscience and nanotechnology were actually 
    the result of the development of nanoscale instrumentation. New instruments capable 
    of measurements at the subcellular level have led to expansion in the understanding of 
    fundamental biological processes (Navarro and Planell 2012). Developments in instrumentation 
    include the 1981 invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). STM permitted images 
    of individual atoms 5 nm in size and was the ﬁrst of several scanning probe microscopes 
    signiﬁcantly to improve the power of instrumentation to study materials at the nanoscale level, 
    leading to later developments such as the atomic force microscope (O’Mathúna 2009; ten Have 2007).

  <h5>2. MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL</h5>
    Nanodelivery systems that utilize encapsulation or coatings with additives allow for increased 
    absorption of pharmaceutical drugs or nutrients such as vitamins, which permits lower dosages 
    and potentially fewer side effects. Due to their ability to pass through cell membranes, carbon 
    nanotubes in particular have demonstrated promise as drug delivery mechanisms (Navarro and Planell 
    2012; Malsch and Emond 2014). Carbon nanotubes also are generating research interest as potential 
    scaffold material for tissue engineering (Malsch and Emond 2014).One of the novel properties of 
    nanoparticles, with various medical applications, involves electromagnetic spectrum reactions 
    that result in the vibration or heating of nanomaterials. One such application would be a type of 
    precision tumor surgery involving gold nanoparticles injected directly into a tumor or delivered 
    as part of a drug dosage to enter cancer cells. Several studies have demonstrated the potential 
    for such delivery mechanisms, and when coupled with low-energy laser pulses, the gold nanoparticles
    caused the cancer cells to explode while leaving surrounding cells unharmed (Evans 2008).Beyond 
    individual therapeutic interventions, much optimism surrounds the potential of nanotechnology to 
    advance the ﬁeld of regenerative medicine. In the goal to repair, replace, or regenerate damaged 
    tissues, William Haseltine and others argue that nanotechnology will play a pivotal role 
    (Navarro and Planell 2012). The inclusion of nanotechnology is often seen as the ﬁnal phase of 
    regenerative medicine, permitting nanoscale examination and analysis of biological structures 
    as well as bottom-up construction of artiﬁcial organs and tissues. Research in this area is often 
    classiﬁed as “nanobiotechnology” and deﬁned as a ﬁeld of inquiry that “applies the nanoscale 
    principles and techniques to understand and transform biosystems (living or non-living) and which 
    uses biological principles and materials to create new devices and systems integrated from the 
    nanoscale” (Navarro and Planell 2012). In this respect, nanobiotechnology shares similarities in 
    the application of engineering methodologies employed in genetic engineering 
    (or, more recently, gene therapy) and synthetic biology.

  <h5>3. AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL</h5>
    Agricultural and environmental applications hold the promise of promoting global equity both in 
    food production, sanitation, and availability of clean water. Additives and engineered nanomaterial 
    (ENM) coatings have the potential to serve as delivery mechanisms for fertilizers, pesticides, and 
    veterinary medicine. Furthermore, such coatings could be applied on packing materials 
    (e.g., silver nanoparticles for antimicrobial protection) to increase longevity of food storage and 
    reduce spoilage (Malsch and Emond 2014). Other potential applications include nanobiosensors 
    – sometimes referred to as “labon-a-chip” technology – to detect food spoilage for improved process 
    monitoring or the presence of environmental contaminants. The combination of nanobiosensors with 
    other technologies such as RFID (radio-frequency identiﬁcation technology) to tag materials or other 
    data communication technologies would allow for such technologies to work in nanosensor networks. 
    Such interaction between technologies would permit the nanobiosensors to report the quality of food 
    products throughout the entire distribution process including at the checkout counter or even a 
    refrigerator (Malsch and Emond 2014).
    Another prospective application is environmental remediation to remove pollutants. One such example 
    would be the utilization of various nanotechnologies to assist in water puriﬁcation (Evans 2008) or 
    the removal of air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (Malsch and Emond 2014). Particularly promising 
    for water puriﬁcation are nanoﬁltration membranes, nanomagnets, and magnetite nanoparticles 
    (Evans 2008; see also Street et al. 2014; Malsch and Emond 2014). Other environmental applications 
    could include nanobiosensors as air or water monitoring systems to identify contaminants.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p>Nanotechnologies have demonstrated the potential to transform the landscape of industrial manufacturing, 
    energy production, environmental sciences, information and communication technologies, and medical 
    research. As one of several emerging technologies, nanotechnologies must be carefully examined for their 
    potential beneﬁts, while closely monitoring the temptations of research hype. Careful consideration must 
    also be given to immediate concerns for potential risks as well as examinations of the broader impact of 
    such technologies for considerations of human nature and human futures both in their individual and 
    global dimensions. Proper technology assessment of these technologies must explore not only important 
    considerations of risk assessment for safety and efﬁciency with respect to individual applications but 
    should raise broader considerations so as to anticipate and address conceptual vacuums that may exist 
    within a rapidly evolving ﬁeld of research and development.</p>
